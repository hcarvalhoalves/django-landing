{"name":"Django-landing","body":"About Landing\r\n=============\r\n\r\nLanding is a simple Django application for implementing A/B tests on\r\nyour site. The original concept was inspired by Vanity for Rails, but\r\nthe implementation is different - better suited to how Django apps work.\r\n\r\nIt can be plugged right into any working Django project, and be used to\r\ntrack visitor’s conversions according to any metric you want. It also\r\ngenerates on-the-fly reports for each experiment, easy to use by\r\ndevelopers, designers and management alike.\r\n\r\nTo setup Landing for you Django project\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-   Add to your installed apps on \\`settings.py\\`\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\r\n        'django.contrib.sessions',\r\n        ...\r\n        'landing',\r\n    )\r\n\r\nLanding depends on \\`django.contrib.sessions\\`, so make sure it’s there\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n-   Add the URL routing for reports\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\r\n        ...\r\n        (r'^landing/', include('landing.urls')),\r\n    )\r\n\r\nYou can also wrap the views to protect the reports under a login, use\r\ndifferent templates or anything like that. Landing uses only 2 views:\r\n\\`landing.views.list\\` and \\`landing.views.report\\`.\r\n\r\nTo start using Landing on your project\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-   Register a new metric you want to track\r\n\r\nAt any module level code (I recommend the \\`views.py\\`):\r\n\r\n    from landing import register_metric\r\n\r\n    signup_options = ['simple', 'complete']\r\n    signup_metric = register_metric('Signup', 'Test 2 signup forms',\r\n                                    options=signup_options)\r\n\r\nThe metric could also, in theory, be loaded with fixtures or via the\r\nadmin.\r\n\r\n-   Decorate your views for tracking the metric\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n    @track(signup_metric)\r\n    def my_view(request):\r\n        if getattr(request, 'tracking', None):\r\n            # Do something with tracking\r\n\r\nIf the \\`request.tracking\\` object is present, it means we were able to\r\ntrack a visitor (cookies enabled), and also able to assign a random\r\noption - it’s acessible at \\`request.tracking.option\\`. For the next\r\nrequests, this visitor will consistently be assigned the same option\r\n(until, of course, cookies are not valid anymore).\r\n\r\nYour code can then branch accordingly to each option that was assigned.\r\nSome use cases would include using different form classes, loading\r\ndifferent templates, or showing different pieces of a template. It all\r\ndepends on the variables you want to experiment with.\r\n\r\nOnce your visitor reaches a checkpoint in your view (e.g., signup done),\r\nyou track a conversion for it with:\r\n\r\n    @track(signup_metric)\r\n    def signup(request):\r\n        ...\r\n        if form.is_valid():\r\n            request.tracking.track() # Record a conversion\r\n            ...\r\n\r\nThat’s it. From now on you can check the reports (if following this\r\n\\`README\\`, it would be available at \\`/landing/\\`) and see how your\r\nexperiment progresses. It presents the conversion rates, the best option\r\n(with a confidence level of at least 90%) and also a graph for\r\nconversions by period, so you can see how conversions spread during the\r\nexperiment period and quickly assess any biases.\r\n\r\nAs the experiment progresses and reaches to a conclusion, you can have\r\nyour code automaticaly select the optimal choice with something like:\r\n\r\n    form_options = {'simple': SimpleForm, 'complete': CompleteForm}\r\n\r\n    def signup_form(request):\r\n        ...\r\n        if signup_metric.choice(): # Best, statistical relevant option\r\n            form_class = form_options.get(signup_metric.choice().value)\r\n            ... # Proceed, now with the proven best form ;)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about A/B testing and the statistics involved at:\r\n[http://20bits.com/articles/hypothesis-testing-the-basics][]/\r\n\r\nThe original GitHub project page is at:\r\n[http://github.com/hcarvalhoalves/django-landing][]\r\n\r\nAbout Vanity, our inspiration source: [http://vanity.labnotes.org][]/\r\n\r\n  [http://20bits.com/articles/hypothesis-testing-the-basics]: http://20bits.com/articles/hypothesis-testing-the-basics\r\n  [http://github.com/hcarvalhoalves/django-landing]: http://github.com/hcarvalhoalves/django-landing\r\n  [http://vanity.labnotes.org]: http://vanity.labnotes.org","tagline":"Landing, a simple A/B testing application for Django","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
