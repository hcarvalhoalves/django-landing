        <h1>About Landing</h1>

<p>Landing is a simple Django application for implementing A/B tests on
your site. The original concept was inspired by Vanity for Rails, but
the implementation is different - better suited to how Django apps work.</p>

<p>It can be plugged right into any working Django project, and be used to
track visitor’s conversions according to any metric you want. It also
generates on-the-fly reports for each experiment, easy to use by
developers, designers and management alike.</p>

<h2>To setup Landing for you Django project</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Add to your installed apps on `settings.py`</li>
</ul><pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    ...
    'landing',
)
</code></pre>

<p>Landing depends on `django.contrib.sessions`, so make sure it’s there
too.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Add the URL routing for reports</li>
</ul><pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    (r'^landing/', include('landing.urls')),
)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also wrap the views to protect the reports under a login, use
different templates or anything like that. Landing uses only 2 views:
`landing.views.list` and `landing.views.report`.</p>

<h2>To start using Landing on your project</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Register a new metric you want to track</li>
</ul><p>At any module level code (I recommend the `views.py`):</p>

<pre><code>from landing import register_metric

signup_options = ['simple', 'complete']
signup_metric = register_metric('Signup', 'Test 2 signup forms',
                                options=signup_options)
</code></pre>

<p>The metric could also, in theory, be loaded with fixtures or via the
admin.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Decorate your views for tracking the metric</li>
</ul><pre><code>@track(signup_metric)
def my_view(request):
    if getattr(request, 'tracking', None):
        # Do something with tracking
</code></pre>

<p>If the `request.tracking` object is present, it means we were able to
track a visitor (cookies enabled), and also able to assign a random
option - it’s acessible at `request.tracking.option`. For the next
requests, this visitor will consistently be assigned the same option
(until, of course, cookies are not valid anymore).</p>

<p>Your code can then branch accordingly to each option that was assigned.
Some use cases would include using different form classes, loading
different templates, or showing different pieces of a template. It all
depends on the variables you want to experiment with.</p>

<p>Once your visitor reaches a checkpoint in your view (e.g., signup done),
you track a conversion for it with:</p>

<pre><code>@track(signup_metric)
def signup(request):
    ...
    if form.is_valid():
        request.tracking.track() # Record a conversion
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it. From now on you can check the reports (if following this
`README`, it would be available at `/landing/`) and see how your
experiment progresses. It presents the conversion rates, the best option
(with a confidence level of at least 90%) and also a graph for
conversions by period, so you can see how conversions spread during the
experiment period and quickly assess any biases.</p>

<p>As the experiment progresses and reaches to a conclusion, you can have
your code automaticaly select the optimal choice with something like:</p>

<pre><code>form_options = {'simple': SimpleForm, 'complete': CompleteForm}

def signup_form(request):
    ...
    if signup_metric.choice(): # Best, statistical relevant option
        form_class = form_options.get(signup_metric.choice().value)
        ... # Proceed, now with the proven best form ;)
</code></pre>
